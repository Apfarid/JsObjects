## DevReady

In the UnitTests folder you will find a file called [TestReady][tr]. It sets up the:

1. test runner called **Karma**
1. build utility called **Grunt**
1. syntax checker called **JsHint**
1. testing framework called **Jasmine**
1. And it creates a default unit test in a directory called **spec**

To prove that we have done the above steps correctly, we create a default test and run it.

**NOTE**: *Make sure you have installed **js-beautify**. This utility can help you properly format and indent your javascript files.*

```
npm install -g js-beautify
```
