# JsObjects

Code by Charlie Calvert for Elvenware.

Various JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, and Python Projects covering
basic programming issues. To install a readonly copy:

    git clone http://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects.git

I have many different example programs stored in this
repository. Note especially the Utilities and JavaScript
directories. And many other things as well.

All the code in JsObjects is released under the MIT license.

## Core Setup

On Linux systems, you can run the [UbuntuAndCloundNineSetup][ubuntu-setup] script. Choose either the first or second option from the script's menu:

```text
Ubuntu
  a) Run All (Basic and Node Related)
  b) Run Basic Setup (All but Node Related)
```

The first will install node and set up your system for work in my classes. The second will set up your system, but will not install node.

When you are done, type the following:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
