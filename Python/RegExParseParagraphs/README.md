Reformat Paragraphs
-------------------

This program replaces all the <p> elements in an
HTML document that span multiple lines with <p>
elements that are on one line.

Suppose you had a paragraph that looked like this:

<p>This is
the sample
paragraph.</p>

The program would turn it into this:

<p>This is the sample paragraph.</p>

To run the program type python replace.py. The 
output will be a copy of MediaWiki.html with all
the <p> elements on one line.
